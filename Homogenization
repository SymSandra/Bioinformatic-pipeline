Homogenization and DNA extraction
Materials:
• Lysis buffer (before using, place in a container with warm water to dissolve the solution):

• Proteinase K (stored in the freezer -20C),
• Ceramic/glass/metal beads,
• 2 ml screw-cap tubes or 1.2 ml strip tubes with caps,
• SPRI magnetic beads – take out from the fridge and keep at room temperature for 1 hour before use,
• deep well plate,
• 80% ethanol (freshly made),
• TE x 1.
Equipment:
• Homogenizer,
• Metal spatula,
• Thermal block or water bath,
• Magnetic plate.

Homogenization:
1. Prepare a tube for each sample, plus one for blank, and sign them on the side (the inscriptions
on the lid may wear off).
2. To each tube, add 190 ul of Lysis buffer, 10 ul of Proteinase K (amount of reagent used for insects not bigger than 10 mm), and grinding beads. For very small specimens (< 2mm), 
we use one 2.8 mm ceramic bead and one spoon (metal spatula) of 0.5 mm ceramic or glass beads, 
and for medium insects (2-10 mm), we add two 2.8 mm ceramic beads (0.5 mm beads might also be added). 
Bigger insects might need a higher volume of Lysis buffer. 
3. Move your specimens to the tubes. Sterilize the tweezers with a flame after each sample.
4. Place the tubes in the homogenizer and grind two times for 30 s at 5m/s speed (2 ml screw-cap tubes) or two times for 30 s with 4m/s speed (1.2 ml strip tubes).
5. Place the samples in a thermal block/water bath at 56 o C for 2 hours. If possible, vortex samples 1-2 times during incubation.
6. Remove the samples from the thermal block and, after cooling to room temperature, start DNA extraction or store in the fridge (for 1-2 days) or freezer.
