PCR with Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix
Basics:
• Primers normally used to PCR reaction are in 10 uM/ul concentration.
• We carry out a PCR in 10 ul.
• In case of using few primers pairs in one reaction (multiplex), higher primer
concentration might be needed.
• When preparing Master Mix always use more reagents than needed (~10% more).
• Always sign the PCR plate with your name and date.
• Amount of all ingredients used in PCR and reaction volume might be changed freely, but „2x Qiagen Buffer” must always be half the volume.
• Do not have to prepare PCR on ice!
