PCR with Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix
Basics:
• Primers normally used to PCR reaction are in 10 uM/ul concentration.
• We carry out a PCR in 10 ul.
• In case of using few primers pairs in one reaction (multiplex), higher primer
concentration might be needed.
• When preparing Master Mix always use more reagents than needed (~10% more).
• Always sign the PCR plate with your name and date.
• The amount of all ingredients used in PCR and reaction volume might be changed freely, but „2x Qiagen Buffer” must always be half the volume.
• Do not have to prepare PCR on ice!

The PCR products were purified using SPRI magnetic beads and used as templates for the second indexing PCR reaction. 
Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq v3 lane (2 × 300 bp reads) at the Institute of Environmental Sciences of Jagiellonian University.
