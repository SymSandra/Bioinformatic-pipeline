Twenty-one initial samples were processed using three different extraction approaches: DNeasy PowerSoil (Qiagen), DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), which the manufacturer protocols were followed, and our custom protocol, outlined below. 
As we found no consistent differences among the protocols, the remaining 191 samples were processed using our custom protocol.

Materials:
• SPRI magnetic beads (stored in the fridge (+4 o C)  – take out from the fridge and keep at room temperature 1 hour before use,
• magnet stand,
• deep well plate,
• 80% ethanol,
• TE x 1,

1. Prepare fresh aliquots of 80% EtOH.
2. To 6 μL of homogenate, add 12 μL (x 2.0) of SPRI magnetic beads and mix by pipetting (or vortex).
3. Incubate mixture 5 min at room temperature.
4. Move the mixture to a deep well plate and place the plate on a magnet stand for 2 min.
5. Remove supernatant (use multichannel pipet).
6. Pour alcohol into the plastic trough (reservoir), and using a multichannel pipet, add 100 μL of 80% EtOH to each well.
7. Incubate on a stand for 1 min.
8. Remove supernatant.
9. Repeat steps 6 – 8.
10. Wait 5 min until dry (on magnet stand).
11. Remove samples from the magnet stand, add 20.5 μL of TE x 1, and mix by pipetting.
12. Place on a magnet stand for 2 min.
13. Transfer supernatant (20 μL) to a new 96-well plate. Sign the plate and store it in the fridge (for a few days) or freezer.
